### 1. **Rock vs Mine Prediction**
   - **Dataset**: [Kaggle: Sonar Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mahmudulhaqueshawon/sonar-data?resource=download)
   - **Model Used**: Logistic Regression
   - **Performance**: 
     - Train Accuracy: 80%
     - Test Accuracy: 80%
   - **Objective**: Predict whether the sonar signal corresponds to a rock or a mine, based on features from sonar readings.
   
   **Key Steps**:
   - Data Preprocessing: Analyzing Data.
   - Model Training: Using Logistic Regression to classify sonar data.
   - Model Evaluation: Measuring accuracy, analyzing the results.

### Future Notebooks
I will be continuously adding more notebooks, covering various aspects of Data Science, including:
- **Data Preprocessing**
- **Feature Engineering**
- **Model Evaluation & Hyperparameter Tuning**
- **Deep Learning**
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
