## Data Science Practice Notebooks

Welcome to my Data Science practice repository, where I explore various datasets and apply different machine learning models. This collection includes step-by-step implementations, data analysis, and model evaluations.

### 1. **Rock vs Mine Prediction**
   - **Dataset**: [Kaggle: Sonar Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mahmudulhaqueshawon/sonar-data?resource=download)
   - **Model Used**: Logistic Regression
   - **Performance**: 
     - Train Accuracy: 80%
     - Test Accuracy: 80%
   - **Objective**: Predict whether the sonar signal corresponds to a rock or a mine, based on features from sonar readings.
   
   **Key Steps**:
   - Data Preprocessing: Analyzing Data.
   - Model Training: Using Logistic Regression to classify sonar data.
   - Model Evaluation: Measuring accuracy, analyzing the results.

# 2. **Diabetes Prediction**  
   - **Dataset**: [Diabetes Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akshaydattatraykhare/diabetes-dataset)  
   - **Model Used**: Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
   - **Performance**:  
     - **Training Accuracy**: 78%  
     - **Testing Accuracy**: 77%  
   - **Objective**: To predict whether a person has diabetes based on health-related features.  
   
   ## Key Steps  
   1. **Data Preprocessing** – Cleaning and analyzing and visualizing the dataset to identify patterns.  
   2. **Model Training** – Training the SVM model to classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic.  
   3. **Model Evaluation** – Assessing model performance through accuracy metrics and analysis.
